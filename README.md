# tidal-melting-collaboration

Inspired by easterlies-collaborative-project, this is a collaborative project to work on DIABLO large-eddy simulations of ice-shelf melting driven by a tidal currents. Note that we started this project offline, so the early stages are not documented here. This is a central repository where we can work on analysis scripts together, suggest new analysis directions, discuss figures etc.

## How it works
All aspects of the project will be tracked through issues. Create an issue to represent each small task. Issues will develop to include discussion of analysis methods and figures associated with each task.

To start contributing to the code, make your own branch directly in this repository, edit away on your branch, and then submit pull requests between your branch and the master branch (or merge directly).

As we figure out the main results and develop the storyline, we can add to the [Results Summary](Results_summary.md) and [draft figure list](Figures.md).
